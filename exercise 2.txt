Optimized Code- Exercise - 2
Problem Statement: Inefficient querying of child items(Using two SOQL Queries).
Solution Implemented: Merge both SOQL queries into single statement and differenciate in the if block.

trigger accountTrigger on Account (before delete, before insert, before update) {
	List<Account> accountWithBothOpportunity = [select id, name, (select id, name, closedate, stagename from Opportunities
	where accountId IN :Trigger.newMap.keySet() and StageName IN ('Closed - Lost','Closed - Won'))
	from Account where Id IN : Trigger.newMap.keySet()];

	for(Account a : accountWithBothOpportunity){
		for(Opportunity o: a.Opportunities){
			if(o.stageName == 'Closed - Lost'){
				System.debug('Do more logic here...');
			}

			else if(o.stageName == 'Closed - Won')
				System.debug('Do more logic here...');
			}
		}
	}
}
